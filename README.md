## Hi there 👋

### Who doesn't love a good puzzle? That's how I feel about coding!
I'm a 👩‍💻 Frontend Software Engineer and a :construction_worker: building architect, specialized in Web Development, BIM Management and committed to ambitious projects with new challenges.

I am a better developer thanks to my career path in construction architecture, bringing into my code creativity to design and structure to problem solving.
